# Computer-Graphics

This repository contains elementary computer graphics related projects using OpenGL and C++.

## Project 1: Basic OpenGL, input & interaction, and animation.
  * The basic structure of an OpenGL program,
  * How to use some basic OpenGL functions,
  * How to use the GLUT (FreeGLUT) callback to get user input and enable interaction,
  * How to use double-buffering to make animation look smoother, and
  * How to use the GLUT (FreeGLUT) timer callback to control the speed of animation.

## Project 2: OpenGL viewing, OpenGL transformations, hierarchical modeling, and animation.
  * How to set up the view transformation (camera position and orientation) in OpenGL,
  * How to set up perspective viewing in OpenGL,
  * How to use the OpenGL transformations for modeling, and
  * How to use the OpenGL transformations for animation.

## Project 3: Writing OpenGL program to simulate planar reflection using texture-mapping and a multipass rendering technique.
  * Set up texture mapping in OpenGL,
  * Model and draw texture-mapped objects,
  * Set up off-center view frustum,
  * Read back image in framebuffer for texture mapping, and
  * Simulate planar reflection using a multi-pass rendering technique.

## Project 4: Implementing the Whitted Ray Tracing algorithm.
  * How to compute ray intersection with some simple implicit-form surface primitive,
  * How to do lighting computation,
  * How to shoot shadow rays to generate shadows,
  * How to spawn secondary rays,
  * How to trace rays recursively, and
  * How the Whitted Ray Tracing algorithm works.
